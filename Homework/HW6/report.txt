0. For each of the coding problems below:
   (a) Describe an exhaustive solution, and analyze compleixty (might be exponential).

For first one: keep trying to change the items in the bag
	time:(2 ^ n)
	space:(2 ^ n)
For second one: keep trying to change the items in the bag utile the copy of item is 0:
	time:O(min(W/w,c)^n)
	space:O(min(W/w,c)^n)
   (b) Describe a greedy solution, and analyze complexity.
For first one:keep getting the smallest number of v[i]/w[i] of items
For second one: keep getting the smallest number of v[i]/w[i] of items utile the copy of item is 0:
   (c) Show a counterexample to the greedy solution.
For first one:
Greedy(3, [(1, 2), (2, 5)])-------(5,[0,1])
Best(3, [(1, 2), (2, 5)])------ (7, [1, 1])
For second one: 
Greedy(3, [(1, 2,1), (2, 5,2)])-------(5,[0,1])
Best(3, [(1, 2), (2, 5)])------ (7, [1, 1])

   (d) Theoretically, is the top-down solution faster, or the bottom-one one faster?
For both of them: top-down will be faster
   (e) Empirically, which one is faster? (Try some long random lists) 
For first one:
    top down:        10 loops, 22.1 ms per loop
    bottom up:       10 loops, 11.3 ms per loop
For second one:
    top down:        10 loops, 154 ms per loop
    bottom up:       10 loops, 86.6 ms per loop
